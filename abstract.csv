0,Experiences with IoT and ML in a Smart Campus for Optimizing Classroom Usage,"Increasing demand for university education is putting pressure on campuses to make better use of their real-estate resources. Evidence indicates that enrollments are rising, yet attendance is falling due to diverse demands on student time and easy access to online content. This paper outlines our efforts to address classroom under-utilization in a real University campus arising from the gap between enrollment and attendance. We do so by instrumenting classrooms with IoT sensors to measure real-time usage, using AI to predict attendance, and performing optimal allocation of rooms to courses so as to minimize space wastage. Our first contribution undertakes an evaluation of several IoT sensing approaches for measuring class occupancy, and comparing them in terms of cost, accuracy, privacy, and ease of deployment/operation. Our second contribution instruments 9 lecture halls of varying capacity across campus, collects and cleans live occupancy data spanning about 250 courses over two sessions, and draws insights into attendance patterns, including identification of canceled lectures and class tests, while also releasing our data openly to the public. Our third contribution is to use AI techniques for predicting classroom attendance, applying them to real data, and accurately predicting future attendance with an RMSE error as low as 0.16. Our final contribution is to develop an optimal allocation of classes to rooms based on predicting attendance rather than enrollment, resulting in over 10% savings in room costs with very low risk of room overflows."
1,Neural Network based Chess Engine,"Numerous published studies revealed that various researchers have attempted to build a program that learns to play cognitive games, given little or no earlier knowledge about the rule of the game. A usual chess playing machine thoroughly explores the moving possibilities from a chessboard configuration to choose what the next best move to make. The brute-force searching technique used by the Deep Blue chess engine has made vast impact in the ground of artificial intelligence, but still found to be resource hungry. This paper, with the concept of Artificial Neural Networks presents a very simple and efficient approach to develop an intelligent chess engine which can assist and hint the possible move within the game using the evolutionary and a adaptive computing technique on learning from the human grandmasters."
2,INORA HR System,"In the strategic human resource (HR) management literature, over the past three decades, a shared consensus has developed that the focus should be on HR systems rather than individual HR practices because the effects of HR practices are likely to depend on the other practices within the system. Despite this agreement, the extent to which the fundamental assumption in the field of interactions and synergy in the system holds true is unclear. We present a systematic review of 495 empirical studies on 516 HR systems in which we analyze the development of HR systems research over time and identify important trends, explicitly linking conceptualization and measurement of the HR system. Our findings suggest that the increasingly broad conceptualization and measurement of HR systems and the lack of clarity on the HR systems construct at different levels have hampered research progress. Much of the research to date does not align with the fundamental assumption of synergies between HR practices in a system, the measures have problems and increasingly confound HR systems with related concepts and outcomes, and insufficient attention is paid to the HR system construct at different levels. Overall, we thus still know little about the “systems” element and how synergies and interactions in an HR system operate. We offer actionable suggestions on how to advance HR systems research towards conceptual clarity and construct refinement, focusing both on how to conceptualize, measure, and combine practices in systems and on studying such systems at different levels of analysis."
3,Automated Satellite Data Analysis System for Land Use & Land Cover Identification ,"In this paper, urban growth of Bangalore region is analyzed and discussed by using multi-temporal and multi-spectral Landsat satellite images. Urban growth analysis helps in understanding the change detection of Bangalore region. The change detection is studied over a period of 39 years and the region of interest covers an area of 2182 km2. The main cause for urban growth is the increase in population. In India, rapid urbanization is witnessed due to an increase in the population, continuous development has affected the existence of natural resources. Therefore observing and monitoring the natural resources (land use) plays an important role. To analyze changed detection, researcher’s use remote sensing data. Continuous use of remote sensing data helps researchers to analyze the change detection. The main objective of this study is to monitor land cover changes of Bangalore district which covers rural and urban regions using multi-temporal and multi-sensor Landsat - multi-spectral scanner (MSS), thematic mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic mapper plus (ETM+) MSS, TM and ETM+ images captured in the years 1973, 1992, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011. Temporal changes were determined by using maximum likelihood classification method. The classification results contain four land cover classes namely, built-up, vegetation, water and barren land. The results indicate that the region is densely developed which has resulted in decrease of water and vegetation regions. The continuous transformation of barren land to built-up region has affected water and vegetation regions. Generally, from 1973 to 2011 the percentage of urban region has increased from 4.6% to 25.43%, mainly due to urbanization."

5,Smart Baby Cradle system,"Cradle is a device that is used to put babies tosleep. Cradle has a side- to-side rocking motion that eases thebaby and put it to sleep. It takes lot of efforts from parent tophysically rock the cradle to generate swinging motion. Whenbaby is kept inside the cradle need to be constant monitoringparent to keep to track of baby's activity. The proposed idea inthis prototype of smart cradle will allow the cradle to efficientlyintegrate itself with a smartphone typically android device. AnArduino microcontroller will be used to assemble all the sensorsand hardware component required. Constant monitoring of thebaby inside the cradle will be done. If any activity such asurination or baby waking up from sleep occurs a notificationthrough an SMS will be sent to the parent’s device. The Smartcradle will also have additional features such as rocking the babyautomatically via geared motor mechanism. Also with someadditional features such as watching the baby live throughArduino camera. Use of various sensors such as PIR (passiveinfrared) sensor to detect light level inside the cradle, and PCBfor sensing wet conditions etc. will only add to the efficiency ofthe cradle. The cradle is suitable for parents who are not able toinvest all their time at home sitting near the baby. Otherapplications of this cradle can be at a maternity hospital as anassistant to the staff who are responsible to look after the baby."
6,Grievence Redressal System,"The aim of this research is to develop a unified model of electronic government (e-government) system adoption and validate it using the data gathered from 419 citizens from few selected cities in India. In course of doing so, the research also evaluates the performance of nine well-known alternative theoretical models of information technology (IT) adoption including the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The results indicate that the proposed unified model for e-government adoption by this research has outperformed all other theoretical models by explaining highest 66% variance on behavioral intentions, adequately acceptable levels of fit indices, and significant relationships between each hypothesis. The research also provides its limitations and presents implications for theory and practice toward the end."
7,Guesture Controlled Home Automation,"In this paper, we propose a Voice and Gesture Operated home automation system with a centralcontroller that allows disabled people to manipulate household appliances with their own voiceand gesture commands. The developed system consists of three main parts, such as KinectMotion Sensor, Central Controller, and Network Coordinator. The whole system is based on aWireless Sensor Network with a gateway to communicate with each device-controlling unit,which is fixed in each room or device group. Sensor node houses a Nodemcu and an Opto-isolator relay module where each Nodemcu works as a webserver and a client simultaneously,in order to communicate with the central computer that is allocated with a designated IPaddress. With this approach, system shows over 80% accuracy with gesture and voice withexternal noise level."

10,Medical Data analysis using Deep Learning ,"With the wide application of computer technology, medical health data has also increased dramatically, and data-driven medical big data analysis methods have emerged as the times require, providing assistance for intelligent identification of medical health. However, due to the mixed medical big data format, many incomplete records, and a lot of noise, it is still difficult to analyze medical big data. Traditional machine learning methods can’t effectively mine the rich information contained in medical big data, while deep learning builds a hierarchical model by simulating the human brain. It has powerful automatic feature extraction, complex model construction and efficient feature expression, and more important. It is a deep learning method that extracts features from the bottom to the top level from the original medical image data. Therefore, this paper constructs a data analysis model based on deep learning for medical images and transcripts, and is used for intelligent identification and diagnosis of diseases. The model uses massive medical big data to select and optimize model parameters, and automatically learns the pathological analysis process of doctors or medical researchers through the model, and finally intelligently conducts disease judgment and effective decision based on the analysis results of medical big data. The experimental results show that the method can analyze the medical big data, and can realize the early diagnosis of the disease. At the same time, it can analyze the physical health status according to the patient’s physical examination records and predict the risk of a certain disease in the future"
11,Two Steps Security in ATM System by using IoT,"The increase of automated teller machine (ATM) frauds has actuated the development of new authentication mechanisms that can overcome the security problems associated with the personal identification numbers (PIN). The traditional PIN entry system has stood the test of time mainly because of its speed and memorability which are part of the metrics used to access the ATM authentication system. The third metric, which is security has often been compromised thence the need for a more secured authentication system for ATM operations. This paper therefore proposes an enhanced ATM security system using second level authentication process. The method adopted for this research is to develop an enhancement of the existing system by building an additional security mechanism on the existing system’s security mechanism. The proposed system was found to be realistic and cost effective when compared to other proposed authentication mechanism for ATM transactions."
12,Blood Bank Management,"In social media platforms, hate speech can be a reason of “cyber conflict” which can affectsocial life in both of individual-level and country-level. Hateful and antagonistic contentpropagated via social networks has the potential to cause harm and suffering on an individualbasis and lead to social tension and disorder beyond cyber space. However, social networkscannot control all the content that users post. For this reason, there is a demand for automaticdetection of hate speech. This demand particularly raises when the content is written in complexlanguages (e.g. Arabic). Arabic text is known with its challenges, complexity and scarcity of itsresources. This paper will present a background on hate speech and its related detectionapproaches. In addition, the recent contributions on hate speech and its related anti-socialbehaviour topics will be reviewed. Finally, challenges and recommendations for the Arabic hatespeech detection problem will be presented"
13,Hate Speech Detection,"A key challenge for automatic hate-speech detection on social media is the separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Lexical detection methods tend to have low precision because they classify all messages containing particular terms as hate speech and previous work using supervised learning has failed to distinguish between the two categories. We used a crowd-sourced hate speech lexicon to collect tweets containing hate speech keywords. We use crowd-sourcing to label a sample of these tweets into three categories: those containing hate speech, only offensive language, and those with neither. We train a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these different categories. Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows when we can reliably separate hate speech from other offensive language and when this differentiation is more difficult. We find that racist and homophobic tweets are more likely to be classified as hate speech but that sexist tweets are generally classified as offensive. Tweets without explicit hate keywords are also more difficult to classify."
14,Explainable AI for Intrusion Detection System,"Cybersecurity is a domain where the data distribution is constantly changing with attackers exploring newer patterns to attack cyber infrastructure. Intrusion detection system is one of the important layers in cyber safety in today's world. Machine learning based network intrusion detection systems started showing effective results in recent years. With deep learning models, detection rates of network intrusion detection system are improved. More accurate the model, more the complexity and hence less the interpretability. Deep neural networks are complex and hard to interpret which makes difficult to use them in production as reasons behind their decisions are unknown. In this paper, we have used deep neural network for network intrusion detection and also proposed explainable AI framework to add transparency at every stage of machine learning pipeline. This is done by leveraging Explainable AI algorithms which focus on making ML models less of black boxes by providing explanations as to why a prediction is made. Explanations give us measurable factors as to what features influence the prediction of a cyberattack and to what degree. These explanations are generated from SHAP, LIME, Contrastive Explanations Method, ProtoDash and Boolean Decision Rules via Column Generation. We apply these approaches to NSL KDD dataset for intrusion detection system and demonstrate results."
15,Waste Management System,"Several studies and researches have been conducted on the sources and characteristics of wastes as well as thepossible adverse effect of inappropriate handling and best international practices. One thing that is still not clearhowever is what exactly constitutes a waste? How much do we know about what should be classed as waste?What are the historical contexts of waste managements? The present paper seeks to examine these vital questionswith a view to providing answers from previous studies. The paper employed a desktop approach to provideanswers to the research objectives. Specifically, the paper uses a descriptive approach to gather information frompeer reviewed publications such as, journal articles, environmental organizations reports and books. It was foundthat, waste is to a large extent subjective in meaning as a substance can only be regarded as a waste when theowner labels it as such. This is particularly true because one individual may regard a substance as a waste, whileanother may view the same substance as a resource. Nevertheless, it was argued that there is a need to clearlydefine what constitute wastes as this form the basis for regulation"
16,Pneumonia detection using Deep Learning,"Artificial intelligence has found its use in various fields during the course of its development, especially in recent years with the enormous increase in available data. Its main task is to assist making better, faster and more reliable decisions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly finding their application in medicine. This is especially true for medical fields that utilize various types of biomedical images and where diagnostic procedures rely on collecting and processing a large number of digital images. The application of machine learning in processing of medical images helps with consistency and boosts accuracy in reporting. This paper describes the use of machine learning algorithms to process chest X-ray images in order to support the decision-making process in determining the correct diagnosis. Specifically, the research is focused on the use of deep learning algorithm based on convolutional neural network in order to build a processing model. This model has the task to help with a classification problem that is detecting whether a chest X-ray shows changes consistent with pneumonia or not, and classifying the X-ray images in two groups depending on the detection results. Index Terms-artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; deep learning; image processing, machine learning; pneumonia detection."
17,Phone Spy - The Parental control,"Android parental control applications are used by parents to monitor and limit their children’s mobile behaviour ( e.g., mobile apps usage, web browsing, calling, and texting). In order to offer this service, parental control apps require privileged access to system resources and access to sensitive data. This may significantly reduce the dangers associated with kids’ online activities, but it raises important privacy concerns. These concerns have so far been overlooked by organizations providing recommendations regarding the use of parental control applications to the public. We conduct the first in-depth study of the Android parental control app’s ecosystem from a privacy and regulatory point of view. We exhaustively study 46 apps from 43 developers which have a combined 20M installs in the Google Play Store. Using a combination of static and dynamic analysis we find that: these apps are on average more permissions-hungry than the top 150 apps in the Google Play Store, and tend to request more dangerous permissions with new releases; 11% of the apps transmit personal data in the clear; 34% of the apps gather and send personal information without appropriate consent; and 72% of the apps share data with third parties (including online advertising and analytics services) without mentioning their presence in their privacy policies. In summary, parental control applications lack transparency and lack compliance with regulatory requirements. This holds even for those applications recommended by European and other national security centers."

36,AI to build Architecture Floor Plan of buildings using GAN ,"This study aims to produce Andrea Palladio’s architectural plan schemes autonomously with generative adversarial networks(GAN), and to evaluate the plan drawing productions of GAN as a generative plan layout tool. GAN is a class of deep neural nets which is a generative model. In deep learning models, repetitive processes can be automated. Architectural drawing is a repetitive process in the act of architecture and plan drawing process can be made automated. For the automation of plan production system we used deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) which is a subset of GAN models. And we evaluated the outputs of the DCGAN Palladian Plan scheme productions. Results show that not geometric similarities (shapes), but probabilistic models are at the centre of the generative system of GAN."
